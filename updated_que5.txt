Here, the 'awk' command is configured to use semicolon (;) as the field separator with awk -F';'. 
This means it splits each line into fields based on semicolon. 
If a line doesn't contain the semicolon, it results in empty fields, leading to blank lines in the output file.
Since many lines don't contain semicolon in it,the output file from the shell script has a lot of blank lines.
