In the shell script, it will print "Successful" at the end regardless of whether the file handling is successful or not.
You are absolutely right, as I am not checking if anything has gone wrong.
I need to manually perform error checking or validation for file handling operations in this script.
Kindly check updated "que3.sh" and "output_data.tsv" now.
